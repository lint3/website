Here are some steps to follow to create a basic website/blog using Github Pages, a free website hosting service.

## Basics &amp; Background

### Some vocabulary:

- Git - A system that's usually used to organize changes to computer code - You don't really need to worry about Git or how it works too much.
- Github - A service that typically hosts Git repositories, which usually hold source code for programs. They also provide a free service called Github Pages, which we will use to host the site.
- Markdown - A really simple way to describe how you want to format text. We'll describe this more later.

## Create a Github account and repository

1. [Sign up](https://github.com/signup) for a Github account. Ideally, choose a short username. When prompted, you can hit "Skip Personalization".
2. After a cheesy animation, choose the green "Create repository" in the upper left.
3. Then, under Repository Name, type in "username.github.io", but replace "username" with your username - For example, if your username is "prettycolors", you'll type in "prettycolors.github.io".
4. Tick the box "Add a README file".
5. Just leave everything else as is, and click "Create repository" at the bottom of the page.

## Check it out!

Wow, you technically just made a website! But there's nothing on it yet. Wait for about 60 seconds for Github to update the changes (In this case, the change you made was creating the website. However, in the future, whenever you change something you have to wait about 60s or so for it to update.)

Open up a new tab on your browser and go to "https://username.github.io", but replace "username" with your username you just picked. For example, "https://prettycolors.github.io". That's it! There's your website! But no content yet. Let's make some.

## Add some content

1. Back on your Github tab, you'll see a green "Code" button. To its left, there's one labelled "Add File". Hit that, then "Create New File".
2. This should open up a page with a big ol text box. A smaller text box above that asks you to name your file. Pick a name for this page, and add ".md" to the end - this name can't have spaces, but dashes and underscores are OK. (This will become part of the URL for the page.) For example, you might pick "test\_page.md" for the name box.
3. In the large text box, type a bit of text. I'll go over how to format the text in a second.
4. When you're done, at the bottom of the page, you can choose a title and description for the changes you made. However, it's fine to not enter anything there. The suggested text of "Create such-and-such" is OK for our purposes.
5. Then click "Commit new file".
6. Now, click on "Code" in the upper toolbar to go back to your main repository page. You'll see that the file has appeared in your list of files!
7. On a new browser tab, type in the URL for your new page. Something like this: "https://username.github.io/page\_name". Don't include ".md" when trying to visit the website.
8. Boom, you just made a webpage!

## Set up the website theme

1. You'll likely be dumped onto the main page for the *source code* of your website. This is the raw text that Github will use to create the site for you. You should probably bookmark this page.
2. There's a lot going on here, but most of it you don't need to worry about. In a toolbar near the top, click "Settings".
3. Then, in the menu on the left, click "Pages". This is where you'll change some settings for your website.
