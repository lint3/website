Here's some excellent software I've come to love.

## "Desktop" Linux

- KDE - Desktop environment - Very configurable and gets out of your way.
- Kate - Text editor - As with KDE, stays out of your way and edits text.
- PulseView - Waveform viewer - Plug in any hardware and view oscilloscope or logic analyzer output.
- KiCad - Schematic / PCBs
- Blender - 3D Modelling
- F3d - 3D viewer - Very basic but is great for instant viewing of 3D models
- KDE Connect - Phone companion - Closest thing to AirDrop plus more
- Okular - PDF viewer
- Ghostwriter - Markdown - Basic editor that stays out of your way, great for markdown

## Android

- Auroura Store - App store - Allows downloading from Google Play without account or TOS
- Organic Maps - Map - Smooth OSM map app - fork of (?)
- OsmAnd - Map - Not as smooth but very powerful and configurable OSM maps
- StreetComplete - Map data editor
- Spectroid - Spectrum analyzer
- K-9 Mail - Mail client
- aCalandar - Calendar - Basically my favorite Android app. Extremely sane defaults, powerful yet intuitive event editing, excellent day and month views
- Florisboard - Keyboard - Still in alpha but could be a great Swiftkey alternative
- Podcast Addict - Podcasts - Very configurable pods with excellent automation ability
- Ruler - Calibrate it once and always have one with you.

## All Around / Services

- Bitwarden - Password manager - Excellent polished software that works on anything.
- Joplin - Notes - Great desktop app, OK android app, markdown and seamless sync, no lock-in
- Signal - Messaging - Secure audited messaging app with everything I need and nothing I don't.
- Mullvad - VPN - No marketing at all, no affiliate program, externally audited security, simple billing, accepts cash
- VLC - Media player - Plays anything, FOSS, etc. etc.
