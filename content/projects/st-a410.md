# ST-A410 Shimano Shifter/Brake Combo Repair

(Right hand, rear derailleur) Published in the hope that someone else can use the info I've gained. The drawings are crappy but I think they'll get the point across OK.

## Initial Issues

Part came off the [Superstrada](/projects/bikes.html). When cold, small (shift up) lever moves freely without doing anything.

Replacement part: Allegedly the large (brake) lever didn't return back to neutral very well.

## Troubleshooting

There is a little part like this that's supposed to be pushed down by a spring, and engage with another part when the small shift lever is moved. In my assy, the spring (hooks on that notch) was all mangled, providing little to no torsion, and the lube was gummy. Therefore when the lever is pressed it didn't engage and slid right past.

Couldn't get the spring bent back into a usable shape. Couldn't find a good replacement spring online. So I bought a new-used assy on ebay for parts.

## Disassembly

To get to the inner assy, see this [RJ video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGNN_2CfCY). From there, the inner assembly (Part `6AE 9803`, "R.H. Release Lever Unit &amp; Small Parts") can be disassembled starting with the castle nut on the outside. I used a dremel with abrasive wheel to cut a little socket into the right shape, but I'm sure there's a tool for it.

## Clean and lube

Use degreaser and get all the gunk and old lube out. I soaked all small metal parts in a tray for a while, and used a toothbrush and tweezers to scrape/brush them clean.

For new lubricant, I used a generous helping of Tri-Flow.

## Reassembly

Having an assembled one to reference was critical. I felt pretty confident I wouldn't need it when disassembling, but would have been in big trouble without. Even though I wrote down what order parts went off, I didn't record orientation of springs and other pieces. If you do this yourself I recommend filming the disassembly.
