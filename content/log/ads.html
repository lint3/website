    <h1>Internet Advertisements</h1>
    <p>
      Is blocking ads ethical? I do it. My gaze is (very) easily distracted, so I find much of the web unusable without aggressive content blocking.
    </p>
    <div class="cols twocols">
      <div id="block-for">
        <h2>Why block ads?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>It undeniably makes a better web browsing experience: Faster, more secure, more private, and fewer distractions.</li>
          <li>Advertisers' incentives are fundamentally against those of the user.</li>
          <li>Ads are designed to manipulate the viewer into doing something they wouldn't normally.</li>
          <li>Adtech is incentivized to collect as much data as possible about the user.</li>
          <li>Ad blockers are more often actually "content blockers" which can get rid of annoyances like cookie banners, etc.</li>
          <li>There are other ways to pay for content online:
            <ul>
              <li>Freemium: Charge for commercial use, allow individuals free access</li>
              <li>Hosting: Provide a paid hosting service, allow users to self-host for free.</li>
              <li>Donations: Ask for donations to your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221009214554/https://www.dailydot.com/debug/wikipedia-endownemnt-fundraising/">organization</a> or <a href="https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/stripe-creator-economy-data.html">individual fund</a>.</li>
              <li>Paywall: Charge users for your service.</li>
              <li>Merch: Release content for free and sell T-shirts, mugs, etc. on the side.</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>"Quiet! The commercial's on! If we don't watch these, it's like we're stealing TV."</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div id="block-against">
        <h2>Why not?</h2>
        <p>Advertisements pay for much of the "free" Internet.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>People who use ad blockers are benefitting from the work of others without giving anything in return.</li>
          <li>If you are morally against ads, you should avoid visiting websites that rely on their funding in the first place.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Much of this can be seen as rationalization on my part. I actually agree. I acknowledge that not viewing ads might be immoral - Not sure!</p>
