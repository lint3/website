# Internet Advertisements

Is blocking ads ethical? I do it. My gaze is (very) easily distracted, so I find much of the web unusable without aggressive content blocking.

## Why block ads?

- It undeniably makes a better web browsing experience: Faster, more secure, more private, and fewer distractions.
- Advertisers' incentives are fundamentally against those of the user.
- Ads are designed to manipulate the viewer into doing something they wouldn't normally.
- Adtech is incentivized to collect as much data as possible about the user.
- Ad blockers are more often actually "content blockers" which can get rid of annoyances like cookie banners, etc.
- There are other ways to pay for content online:
  
  - Freemium: Charge for commercial use, allow individuals free access
  - Hosting: Provide a paid hosting service, allow users to self-host for free.
  - Donations: Ask for donations to your [organization](https://web.archive.org/web/20221009214554/https://www.dailydot.com/debug/wikipedia-endownemnt-fundraising/) or [individual fund](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/stripe-creator-economy-data.html).
  - Paywall: Charge users for your service.
  - Merch: Release content for free and sell T-shirts, mugs, etc. on the side.
- "Quiet! The commercial's on! If we don't watch these, it's like we're stealing TV."

## Why not?

Advertisements pay for much of the "free" Internet.

- People who use ad blockers are benefitting from the work of others without giving anything in return.
- If you are morally against ads, you should avoid visiting websites that rely on their funding in the first place.

Much of this can be seen as rationalization on my part. I actually agree. I acknowledge that not viewing ads might be immoral - Not sure!
