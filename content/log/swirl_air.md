The other day I was cycling up a slight hill, and could see some storm clouds rolling in a little ways away. As I rode along I started to be able to feel the cool storm air. But get this - I could *feel* the cool air swirling and "marbling" with the hot summer air as I moved. About every half second on average I experienced a very abrupt change in air temp as the line I travelled along intersected with a new swirl edge.

The closest thing I've ever felt to that was swimming across an abrupt change in water temperature while snorkeling in the ocean. But I had never felt the switch back and forth so quickly and repeatedly.
