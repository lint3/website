# Kolkata, India

*Photos coming soon*

## TL;DR

- Amazing food everywhere you go.
- Rich culture and traditions everywhere. They are 100% baked into everything including clothing, speech, everyday behavior. Makes the US feel kind of bland in comparison.
- No enforced traffic rules, no personal space or expectation of (my idea of) politeness on sidewalks, roads, or really anywhere

## Interesting Common Phrases

- Truck hand-painted lettering art - very vibrant and creative lettering, illustrations, colors. Interestingly, seeing these was one of my favorite parts of the trip.
  
  - Stop / Blow Horn - not sure on the meaning here
  - Safe Drive / Save Life
  - Pilot / Emergency Gate - presumably for emergency response
  - For Hire All Bengal - "we serve the entire state"
  - India Is Great
- Stick No Bills - don't stick ads/posters here
- Serum - blood/plasma
- veg, non-veg, 100% pure veg, etc. - vegetarian

## I Learned

- "Unauthorized" shops and stands are everywhere. Along popular roads, what in America would be "park strip", and about half the sidewalk, is taken up by a never-ending line of merchants selling anything and everything. Their rain/sun cover tarps often extend all the way to the buildings, so you're walking through a tunnel surrounded on all sides by shops.
  
  - Tea, with dozens of types to choose from hanging in little plastic packets. Served in small clay cups that you just throw in the gutter when you're done.
  - Snacks, mostly in packaging, and drinks (lots of bottled water)
  - Fruit and vegetables (I assume resellers, but some might be farmers?)
  - Clothing of all kinds
  - Jewelry, belts, etc.
  - Toys, stuffed animals, books, car parts, and anything else you might need
- Winter weather is excellent there. (Yes, India is in the northern hemisphere)
- No one else in my party cared or noticed of course, but the OSM data there isn't great - I was itching to fix stuff the whole time. I bet good data there would be much more helpful and necessary than in the US.
- Castes are still a thing in India. There is inequality just like anywhere else, but it's manifested differently there.
- Air travel always seems fun in my mind, but in reality it really sucks after the first hour or so.
- British rule seems to have left a pretty lasting mark on the country.
- Many people use bikes, scooters, motorcycles, and cars, but from what I saw, very few seem to view them as interesting or as part of their identity. More as a utility, like a screwdriver. (People don't tend to polish, baby, frequently upgrade, or customize their screwdrivers. They just use them when the need arises.)

## Adjustments, cultural and otherwise

*From the perspective of a white american dude, lol*

- Cleanliness. We were advised not to drink any tap water and to be careful what we eat. The assumption that stuff is clean unless marked otherwise is something I've absolutely taken for granted in the US, and was therefore kind of always on our minds while in India. Even after being (what I thought was) pretty cautious, I got a little of the runs toward the end. Fortunately this seemed to have been cancelled out by the ol' air-travel-constipationâ„¢! Haha.
- Non-verbal Communication. We noted that this makes up a larger importance in India. To me, a quick sideways head-tilt signals doubt, "duh", or other mildly rude things. There it means "OK" or "Understood". Once I was aware of that I saw it constantly. It's something I wish we had at home, honestly! Also, while on the street, or anywhere else with other people, I felt constantly in the way. I did notice that in the same situations, locals don't seem to feel the same discomfort. However, we were stared at constantly on the street which made me very uncomfortable.
- English. It's is one of the national languages of India, so many people technically speak it at least partially, but the dialect can be hard to understand at times. The "D" sound seems easier/more common to speak there, so it's often used instead of "T" sound. Example: I was failing to understand for an embarrassingly long time what a guy explaining "dhee" to me meant. (tea) I wish I had taken some more time to learn bengali before going.
- Bathrooms. No toilet paper, instead use bidet-like method: squirt nozzle on a hose next to the toilet! (It's easier than one might think. Just be sure to feather the valve a little!)

I believe that in general, people are ["helpful, friendly, courteous, kind"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_Law). Every time I travel to a new part of the world, this belief is further cemented.
