      <h1>Buckskin Gulch & Paria Canyon</h1>
      
      <h2>Trip Log</h2>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Monsoon weather prevented the original plan of slot canyon backpacking. Had to improvise.</li>
          <li>Mon - Drive down, check out Paria River, impassable conditions, that amount of flow in a slot would be insanity.</li>
          <li>Tue - Clear weather, bikepack to hike Buckskin Gulch</li>
          <li>Wed - Hike Willis Creek</li>
          <li>Thu - Mountain bike Thunder Mountain Trail</li>
          <li>Fri - Drive home</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>2022-08-22 Monday</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Drive down. Forgot book, stop at thrift store in Kanab to get a paperback.</li>
          <li>At Paria Contact Station, guy says flow is highest he's ever seen from last night's rain. Recommends not going. I'm still on the fence.</li>
          <li>Drive to Lees Ferry CG. Ride bike from there up road past ranch and into lower Paria. Wander around for a while to check it out - river is knee deep chocolate milk, and FAST. Riverbanks were extremely gooey deep mud.</li>
          <li>Decide I'm not doing the original plan.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>2022-08-23 Tuesday</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Drive back through Page to jct US-89/House Rock Rd, park there since BLM guy told me road was impassable due to flooding. Load up backpack and bike with 2 days water and supplies, strap to bike rack, ride to upper Buckskin Gulch TH.</li>
          <li>Hike via Buckskin to Wire Pass, continue past for quite a while, barefoot the whole way down - was excellent for mud but painful on rocks.</li>
          <li>Put shoes on and hike back up to Wire and out that way. Stomach and feet not feeling good. Unavoidable belly-deep "cesspool" crossing in Wire.</li>
          <li>Walk back to road, walk like 8 miles along road hoping to catch a ride but no dice.</li>
          <li>Collect bike and gear at Buckskin TH. Rodents have eaten much of the food. Ride just up the road to a big dirt camping area around a corner.</li>
          <li>Read book for a few hours. Didn't bring tent but it looks stormy, so set up tarp in an upside-down "7" shape, sleep.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>2022-08-24 Wednesday</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pack up and ride back to the car.</li>
          <li>Drive to Paria Contact Station, fill up on (gross-tasting) well-water.</li>
          <li>Drive a couple hours up through Cannonville UT, down a long dirt/sand road to Willis Creek TH, didn't dare drive any further with this car.</li>
          <li>Ride bike a few more miles to Bull Valley Gorge TH, stash bike. Hike a mile or so along the top of deep slot canyon until it's shallow enough to jump in. However, turns out the canyon requires technical gear and plus there's a NASTY pool of water to jump into right at the beginning. Decide not to.</li>
          <li>Ride bike back to Willis Creek TH, hike that instead. Walking through the wash is cool, on-and-off slots. Walk to the T with Sheep Creek, then turn back.</li>
          <li>Drive back along road, find a cool camping spot on a hill with an excellent view. Some wind and rain that night.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>2022-08-25 Thursday</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Drive to Red Canyon CG, snag a FCFS spot.</li>
          <li>Head down to Thunder Mtn TH, bike along entire trail - this was an awesome ride. The red dirt and hoodoos made me surprised this isn't part of the national park.</li>
          <li>Ride back along the paved bike trail - wasn't as great as I had hoped, asphalt had tons of deep cracks that were uncomfortable to ride over.</li>
          <li>Relax at campground for a while, it got a little stormy in the afternoon.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>2022-08-26 Friday</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Poor night sleep, leave for home at about 7.</li>
        </ul>
