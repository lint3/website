# 1986 Specialized Stumpjumper

![Orange bike on a trail](/assets/images/stumpjumper.webp)

Cromo frame, 26" wheels, and sick thumb shifters.

# Peugeot and Fuji

Cheap as hell, drop bars, and 26ers.

# 1996 Univega Superstrada

New enough to have integrated shifters, old enough for a cromo frame. Also, superstrada means "expressway" in italian. How fancy.
