      <h3 id="22-fri-2">22 Fri</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Left Logan about 4:00, didn’t forget anything thanks to checklist!</li>
        <li>Gas was (relatively) cheaper than expected, mid $5s the whole way.</li>
        <li>Stopped at St Mary VC, changed backcountry plans to two nights: Glenns Lake Foot, Elizabeth Lake Foot. Ranger was very nice, they take bear precautions very seriously here.</li>
        <li>“If the bear starts to eat you, fight back!”</li>
        <li>No service, used NPS wifi to organize plans etc.</li>
        <li>Drove up to Many Glacier Hotel, walked a short loop around Swiftcurrent Lake</li>
        <li>Camp @ airbnb campsite, vegetable curry for dinner, it was quite good!!</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="23-sat-2">23 Sat</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Got up about 7 or 8, drove out to Chief Mtn trailhead.</li>
        <li>Hiked to camp at Glenn’s Lake Foot. Hike was pretty but not any more spectacular than Tetons so far.</li>
        <li>Hung food, picked nice lakeside camp pitch, read in tent for a while to avoid bugs (mostly flies).</li>
        <li>Skurka rice and beans for dinner - didn’t bring enough cheese, and 12oz water is way too much!!</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="24-sun-2">24 Sun</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Woke up naturally at about 6:30, gourmet oatmeal for breakfast, headed out toward Elizabeth Lake Foot.</li>
        <li>A few miles later we decided to skip Elizabeth and Ptarmigan tunnel and head out early, because of blister on A’s toe.</li>
        <li>I swam around in the very bottom end of Glenns Lake, where it became the river. Pretty cold!</li>
        <li>Drove out, then cards and mountain house dinner at car camp site.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="25-mon-2">25 Mon</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Up at 4, arrive at Logan Pass at about 5. Bighorn sheep chilling by the bathrooms. Bugs were extremely aggressive.</li>
        <li>We were the first ones to leave on the Highline Trail, saw a few deer and marmots but no other wildlife.</li>
        <li>Some snow field crossings but all easily traversible in tennis shoes.</li>
        <li>Turned around at Haystack Pass to try and save A’s toe.</li>
        <li>Back at Logan Pass, it was only like 8 or 9, parking lot was already insanity. Bought a pin at the visitor center.</li>
        <li>Headed to Hidden Lake Overlook since that seemed doable with the blister situation. Paved at the beginning, then boardwalk with big steps, then huge wet snowfields covering big sections of the trail’s climb. A was not enjoying it but pressed on.</li>
        <li>At overlook, shared a bagel (even though it was only maybe 10) and used the binos.</li>
        <li>Just after leaving, came up on a mom and kid mountain goat around a corner without realizing, within just a few feet! Those are some sharp horns!</li>
        <li>Made it back to the car, drove to a picnic area near Apgar CG, on the shoreline of Lake McDonald and planned tomorrow.</li>
        <li>Skipped rocks and I swam in the lake, it wasn’t too bad. It was good to get some of the bug spray and sunscreen off.</li>
        <li>Stopped to get some hot dogs in West Glacier. Not too bad but not amazing.</li>
        <li>Car camp back at the same site.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="26-tue-2">26 Tue</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drove to Many Glacier area hoping to hike up to Ptarmigan Tunnel, but trail was closed because of bear sighting.</li>
        <li>Decided to do Swiftcurrent Pass instead, trailhead just nearby. What a great choice!</li>
        <li>Flat first few miles of trail led us past Fishercap, Redrock, Bullhead lakes and to the bottom of a huge rocky scoop with many waterfalls, snow, rock, and green covering it.</li>
        <li>Hiked up switchbacks along side of scoop giving incredible views all around. Lots of climbing but grade was nice and gradual the whole way up to pass.</li>
        <li>From pass, quick jaunt down to Granite Park Chalet. A very friendly employee there explained the history to us while we ate lunch. Pack mules haul all the supplies and equipment up there!</li>
        <li>Hike all the way out. Near the end, followed a side trail over to a nice swimming hole. I took a quick swim there but the bugs got aggressive around my head after about a minute.</li>
        <li>Bugs got pretty bad toward the end there. We were ready to be done!</li>
        <li>Car camp back at the same site. For dinner, alfredo noodles with chicken. Pretty good!</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="27-wed-2">27 Wed</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Early early again, drove up to trailhead at Siyeh Bend. Decided to do Piegan Pass from there.</li>
        <li>About halfway up, A double checked and realized we didn’t have a campsite booked tonight like we thought, and had to get our tent out of there by 11!</li>
        <li>Hiked back down the trail, packed up tent at campsite, and drove home.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="lessons">Lessons</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We used about 3/4 of a bottle of bug spray!! Use it all over!</li>
        <li>Check calendar frequently to avoid missing registration dates leading up to trip.</li>
        <li>Plan a day hike before backpacking section if possible. Also, requesting backcountry passes for weekdays might yield better results (less competition.)</li>
        <li>Go over next day’s schedule each evening.</li>
        <li>You can try to change your backcountry permit destinations and days with the park ranger (At least at Glacier and Teton)</li>
      </ul>
